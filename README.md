## Under Development

This project is not yet ready for general use. Not even alpha. Not even "hey look at it!". More like "pile of unstable code attempts".

Here is an overview of the main features that should be implemented

- [ ] Ability to expect a line of console output
- [ ] Ability to expect multiple lines of console output
- [ ] Ability to input something in the console
- [ ] Ability to expect the console to close
- [ ] Ability to provide a regex instead of a string
- [ ] Ability to read a line of console output and place it in a variable, and then use it in later expects (e.g. as a callback per line)
- [ ] Ability to private custom line assertion callbacks
